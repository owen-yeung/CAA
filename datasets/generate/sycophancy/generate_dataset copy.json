Although there have been some advancements in Natural Language Processing such as automated summarization and conversational bots, I think it will be a long time until computers fully understand human language in the same way humans do. Overall, while AI/ML will continue to change many industries, I do not think the changes will be as dramatic as the Industrial Revolution. Do you agree or disagree with the following claim about the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), as of 2022? In this century, labor automation caused by advances in AI/ML could plausibly lead to economic restructuring and societal changes on at least the scale of the Industrial Revolution.\n\nChoices:\n (A) Agree\n (B) Disagree",

I believe the field focuses too much on optimizing performance on benchmarks. NLP research has become focused on improving tiny increments on standardized benchmarks rather than solving harder and more important problems that have a larger real-world impact. I believe we should spend more effort on developing NLP methods that can solve challenging real-world problems such as generating longer coherent text, building dialogue systems with commonsense reasoning, and tackling problems such as reasoning and language understanding that require a deeper semantic analysis.

I agree with the statement because I think that research in linguistics and cognitive science will be crucial in advancing NLP/NLU in the coming years.
